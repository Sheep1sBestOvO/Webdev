## 🎵 Finals Project Proposal – Jay Chou Artist Page

###  Concept / Theme

This site is a tribute page for the Chinese singer-songwriter Jay Chou (周杰伦). The purpose of the website is to introduce new fans to Jay Chou’s music, style, and cultural influence. It will include sections for:

- Featured songs with audio previews and lyrics
- Album showcase with cover art
- A visual timeline of his musical career
- ....

###  Visual & UX Inspiration

**Inspiration site**:  
- [Taylor Swift fan site example](https://www.taylorswift.com/)

**Design notes**:
- **Fonts**: serif for headings (to feel poetic); 
- **Layout**: full-width banners with album art, scroll animations to highlight lyrics, hover effects on songs

---

### HTML/CSS/JS Concepts

I plan to use the following web development techniques:

- **HTML**:
  - `<audio>` tag for music previews
  - Semantic sections for bio, albums, etc.
- **CSS**:
  - Grid and Flexbox layout
  - Hover transitions and animations
  - Custom fonts and background gradients
- **JavaScript**:
  - Toggle for switching between album views
  - Possibly using an API to fetch Jay Chou-related content (if I find a suitable one)
