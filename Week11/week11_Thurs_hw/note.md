## 1. The for...of loop
The `for...of` loop is a simple and elegant way to iterate through collections like arrays.

## 2. map() and filter()

### `map()`
`map()` is used to apply a function to every element of a collection and return a new array with the modified items.


### `filter()`
`filter()` is used to filter out elements from a collection based on a condition.

## 3. Looping through collections with a for loop
`for` loop can also be used to iterate through collections, especially when you need the index.


## 4. do...while loop
The `do...while` loop is similar to `while`, but the loop body is always executed at least once since the condition is checked after the code runs.
